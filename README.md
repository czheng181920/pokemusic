clawitzer's fav music: sea shanties

this project uses openai, spotify api, and a redux-next.js setup. inspired by when i was asking chatgpt what bulbasaur's favorite music was.
some other good responses from chatgpt:
- piplup: bubblegum pop music
- mr. mime: vaudeville music (literally clown music)
## Setup

   ```
   On Windows:
   ```powershell

   ```
3. Add your [API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) spotify client id/secret to the newly created `.env` file
